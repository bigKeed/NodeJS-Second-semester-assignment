NodeJS Assignment
Servers and APIs


1. Without using a framework, build a web server to render html files:
When I navigate to “/index.html”, I should see a simple webpage of the student. (Nothing fancy)
2.Add another feature such that when I navigate to “{random}.html” it should return with a 404 page


Without using a framework, build an api server to manage inventory information. Api should be able to
Create item = /product/add
Get all items = /products 
Get one item = /product/:id
Update item = /product/Update
Delete item = /product/delete

Item should have the following attributes
Name
Price
Size: small(s), medium(m) or large(l)
Id


Things to note:
Return data structure should be consistent among the apis
Ensure code is modular
Handle errors where possible
No need to use database, use file system to persist data eg items.json
